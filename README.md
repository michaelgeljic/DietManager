This is a quick but important status update on your project progress. As of today, there have been no commits to your GitLab repository since April 9, which is a serious concern. You're currently not following the GitLab flow, which is essential not just for version control, but also for transparency and collaboration within the team and with your instructor. 
That’s not acceptable at this stage of the project. Everyone needs to start committing their changes, pushing updates regularly, and using merge requests. Let’s get back on track immediately. 
Please commit your code starting with today.
